# Real-Estate-LBO (WIP)

## Motivation

### WORK-IN-PROGRESS

If you're RE/PE analyst on GitHub, not a quant, and have been trying to do LBO or any other financial models on Python. You are not alone.

The existing codes are based on a sample scenario I received from a modelling test, see scenario.md for details.
Still a work in progress and looking for a way to make it more modular than just tackling sample scenarios.
